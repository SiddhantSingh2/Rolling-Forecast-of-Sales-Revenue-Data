# Rolling-Forecast-of-Sales-Revenue-Data
Creating rolling financial forecasts of important financial KPI is currently hot topic in accounting  and finance. However, it is difficult to create an accurate rolling forecast without automating the  manual effort with machine learning techniques. Rossmann is one of the world's largest retailers,  and precise sales estimates in several categories are critical to their success. In seven European  nations, Rossmann runs more than 3,000 pharmacies. Promotions, competition, state and federal  holidays, seasonality, and locality are just a few of the variables that affect store sales. The project  forecasts store sales predictions using Rossmannâ€™s historical store sales data for different stores  located in different regions leveraging various machine learning techniques.
